    <h2>BMW Company Info</h2>
    <p>The 1962 introduction of the BMW New Class compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading
        manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupé and luxury
        sedan models. The BMW 5 Series mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the BMW 3 Series compact
        sedans in 1975, the BMW 6 Series luxury coupés in 1976 and the BMW 7 Series large luxury sedans in 1978.</p>
    <h2>Maruti Suzuki Info</h2>
    <p>The first prototype of the Maruti car was completed in 1972, with production anticipated to commence by April
        1973, as promised by Sanjay Gandhi.[14] He made the chassis by himself at his workshop, and a Triumph motorcycle
        engine was used to propel the car.[13] Amid allegations of nepotism, the Maruti car underwent a feasibility test
        by the Vehicle Research & Development Establishment in Ahmednagar. The prototype failed the test, being deemed
        unsuitable for road use. Nonetheless, in July 1974, Maruti was granted an industrial license to produce 50,000
        cars.[15] However, the actual production output at Sanjay Gandhi's factory fell short of the initial target.
        Despite the projection to commence production at a rate of 12-20 units per month and escalate to 200 units per
        day, only 21 units were manufactured by 31 March 1976.</p>
